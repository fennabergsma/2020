\section{Background: relative clause theory}
Standard raising, probably Cinque's double-headed structures

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Old High German}
In \ac{ohg}, proper attraction in headless relatives can be derived from headed relatives. The relative pronoun is the determiner from the main clause. Under a double-headed Cinque-analysis, it is the internal DP that is deleted.

\subsection{Modern German}
In German, inverse attraction in headed relatives can be shown to be very different from inverse attraction in headless relatives. I am not set on an analysis yet. Under a double-headed Cinque-analysis, it is the external DP that is deleted. Grafting is also still an option.
