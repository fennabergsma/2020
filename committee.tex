\chapter{The committee}\label{ch:relativization}

In Chapter \ref{ch:case-competition-typology} I introduced two parameters that generates the attested languages, as shown in Table \ref{fig:two-parameters}. The first parameter is `allow mismatches?', which distinguishes between `matching' languages, as Polish, on the one hand, and `non-matching --- internal only' and `non-matching' languages as Modern German and Old High German. The second parameter is `cases considered', which distinguishes between `non-matching --- internal only' languages, as Modern German, on the one hand, and `non-matching' languages, as Old High German.

This chapter gives the linguistic counterparts of these parameters.
The linguistic counterpart of `allow mismatches' is: ???
The linguistic counterpart of `cases considered' is: if \tsc{dem} and \tsc{rel} are syncretic, you consider \tsc{int} and \tsc{ext}. If not, you consider only \tsc{int}.

So far, I have discussed three different concepts: the internal case, the external case and the relative pronoun. I said things like ``the relative pronoun is allowed to surface in the internal or in the external case''. I have not been explicit about where and how the competition between the internal and the external case takes place. In order to avoid introducing machinery just for case competition situations, I assume it takes place in syntax. I propose that headless relatives actually have an internal element and an external element at some point of the derivation. At the end of the derivation, only one of them surfaces as the relative pronoun.

Section \ref{sec:int-ext-elements} discusses the internal and external case into detail. It shows syntactic evidence for the relative being the internal element. I argue that the external element is syntactically placed outside the relative clause. Independent evidence for the presence of this external element comes from double-headed languages. I also adopt another crucial property of the external heads in these double-headed relative clauses: the external head is always a subset of the internal head. This observation ultimately leads me to be able to exclude the `non-matching --- external-only' language type.

However, before I go into detail about the specifics of the internal and the external element, I discuss in Section \ref{sec:containment-noncase} how the introduction of an internal and an external element helps to account for the difference between languages. I propose that both elements consists of part that concerns case, a case part, and a part that concerns other features than case, a base part. The latter parts, the base parts, are crucial in determining how the language behaves with the respect to the two parameters. Specifically, the comparison between the base part of the internal element and the base part of the external element decides whether the internal and elements are allowed to surface. Just as I did for the competition between case features, I rely on containment. When the internal base part contains the features that the external base part contains, the internal element is allowed to surface. When the external base part contains the features that the internal base part contains, the external element is allowed to surface.

In Section \ref{sec:deriving-languages}, I give per language (Old High German, Modern German and Polish) the internal structure of the internal element and the external element. I compare them to each other and show how the grammatical patterns are generated and the ungrammatical ones are not.

In Section \ref{sec:alternative-analyses}, I compare my approach with previous accounts of \citet{himmelreich2017} and Grosu.

\section{Base containment}\label{sec:containment-noncase}

The goal is to explain why there are languages that allow internal and external, languages that allow only internal, but no languages that only allow only external. I propose we do this by comparing the base parts of the internal and the external elements in headless relatives.

Headless relatives have an internal element and an external element. Both elements consist of two parts: the case part and a base part. Part \ref{part:case-facts} was about the case part of the elements. A more complex case wins over a less complex case because the former contains all features the latter contains. Concretely, the dative wins over the accusative because the dative contains all features the accusative contains, the dative wins over the nominative because the dative contains all features the nominative contains, and the accusative wins over the nominative because the accusative contains all features the nominative contains.

I propose that a containment relation is also the crucial factor that determines in whether a particular language allows the internal and external case to surface. It is not the containment relationship having to do with case, but the one that has to do with the base part. I propose that a language allows the internal case to surface when it wins the case competition, if the base part of the internal element contains all features that the base part of the external element contains. The other way around works the same way: a language allows the external case to surface when it wins the case competition, if the base part of the external element contains all features that the base part of the internal element contains.

\begin{table}[H]
  \center
  \caption{Old High German}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
  \toprule
                      & \tsc{int}         & \tsc{ext}         & ✔/* \\
                      \cmidrule{1-4}
\tit{int} = \tit{ext} & \tbf{d}-\tbf{e}-r & \tbf{d}-\tbf{e}-r & ✔   \\
\tit{int} > \tit{ext} & \tbf{d}-\tbf{e}-n & \tbf{d}-\tbf{e}-r & ✔   \\
\tit{int} < \tit{ext} & \tbf{d}-\tbf{e}-r & \tbf{d}-\tbf{e}-n & ✔   \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tbl:base} gives a table that resembles the case tables I discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:case-competition-typology}. The left column shows the features of the internal base part. The top row shows the features of the internal base part. The other cells indicate the features of the winning base part.
If the internal base part contains the features [\tsc{a}] or [\tsc{a}, \tsc{b}], and the external base part contains only the features [\tsc{a}] or [\tsc{a}, \tsc{b}], the internal and the external are allowed to surface in the language. This is the pattern that corresponds to the `non-matching' type of language like Old High German.
If the internal base part contains the feature [\tsc{a}], and the external base part contains only the features [\tsc{a}, \tsc{b}], the external is allowed to surface in the language and the internal is not. This is the pattern that is crosslinguistically not attested. In Section \ref{sec:int-ext-elements} I show why this is the case.
If the internal base part contains the features [\tsc{a}, \tsc{b}], and the external base part contains only the feature [\tsc{a}], the internal is allowed to surface in the language and the external is not. This is the pattern that corresponds to the `non-matching --- internal only' type of language like Modern German.

          & \tsc{a},\tsc{b}
          \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tbl:base}
\end{table}

There is a crucial difference between the Table \ref{tbl:base} and the case tables in Chapter \ref{ch:case-competition-typology}. The case tables described different situations that are attested within a single language, as I illustrated by going through  examples that correspond to different cells in the tables. Case differs from sentence to sentence: in one sentence the internal case is the dative, in the other it is the accusative or the nominative. The base table is not like that: only a single cell in the table corresponds to a particular language. The base parts of the internal and external elements are namely stable per language. The relative pronoun has namely a single form, and so does the external element.

Taking this all together, there are two competitions taking place in headless relatives: case competition and base competition. Case competition decides which case wins the sentence and base competition decides whether the result can go through. Let me put this in the metaphor with the committee I introduced in Section \ref{sec:possible-patterns}. The committee learns who wins the case competition. It can either approve this case or not approve it. The information that the committee uses for their decision is the comparison between the internal and the external element. More specifically, it compares the base parts of the internal and external element. The committee approves the winning case if the base part of its element contains the base part of the element of the losing case.

In sum, a relative pronoun can surface in the internal case if both the base and the case part of the internal element contain base and case part of the external element. It works the same way the other way around: a relative pronoun can surface in the external case if both the base and the case part of the external element contain the base and case part of the internal element.

In this chapter, I introduce what the base part the internal and external element looks like, and I argue per language what they look like.


\section{The internal and external element}\label{sec:int-ext-elements}

The comparison between the internal and external element is crucial in determining what the type of a language is. This section discusses both elements. In Section \ref{sec:internal-element}, I show that the relative pronoun is the internal element, and that this is part of the relative clause. Section \ref{sec:external-element} discusses the external element. This element is syntactically places outside of the relative clause, and its features form a subset of the features of the relative pronoun.

\subsection{The relative pronoun = internal}\label{sec:internal-element}

In headless relative constructions, there is a single element that surfaces: the relative pronoun. In this section, I show that the relative pronoun is syntactically part of the relative clause. The evidence comes from extraposition data in Modern German. In Modern German, it is possible to extrapose a CP (a clause), but not a DP (a noun phrase). In this section I first show that Modern German CPs can be extraposed and DPs cannot. Then I illustrate how relative clauses including the relative pronoun in headless relatives pattern with CPs: they can be extraposed as well. I conclude that the relative pronoun is the internal element in the headless relative.

The sentences in \ref{ex:mg-extrapose-cp} show that it is possible to extrapose a CP. In \ref{ex:mg-extrapose-cp-base}, the clausal object \tit{wie es dir geht} `how you are doing', marked here in bold, appears in its base position. It can be extraposed to the right edge of the clause, shown in \ref{ex:mg-extrapose-cp-moved}.

\ex.\label{ex:mg-extrapose-cp}
\ag. Mir ist \tbf{wie} \tbf{es} \tbf{dir} \tbf{geht} egal.\\
 1\tsc{sg}.\tsc{dat} is how it 2\tsc{sg}.\tsc{dat} goes {the same}\\
 `I don't care how you are doing.'\label{ex:mg-extrapose-cp-base}
\bg. Mir is egal \tbf{wie} \tbf{es} \tbf{dir} \tbf{geht}.\\
 1\tsc{sg}.\tsc{dat} is {the same} how it 2\tsc{sg}.\tsc{dat} goes\\
 `I don't care how you are doing.' \label{ex:mg-extrapose-cp-moved}\flushfill{Modern German}

\ref{ex:mg-extrapose-dp} illustrates that it is impossible to extrapose a DP. The clausal object of \ref{ex:mg-extrapose-cp} is replaced by the simplex noun phrase \tit{die Sache} `that matter'.
In \ref{ex:mg-extrapose-dp-base} the object, marked in bold, appears in its base position. In \ref{ex:mg-extrapose-dp-moved} it is extraposed, and the sentence is no longer grammatical.

\ex.\label{ex:mg-extrapose-dp}
\ag. Mir ist \tbf{die} \tbf{Sache} egal.\\
 1\tsc{sg}.\tsc{dat} is that matter {the same}\\
 `I don't care about that matter.'\label{ex:mg-extrapose-dp-base}
\bg. *Mir ist egal \tbf{die} \tbf{Sache}.\\
 1\tsc{sg}.\tsc{dat} is {the same} that matter\\
 `I don't care about that matter.' \label{ex:mg-extrapose-dp-moved}\flushfill{Modern German}

The same asymmetry between CPs and DPs can be observed with relative clauses. A relative clause is a CP, and the head of a relative clause is a DP. The sentences in \ref{ex:extra-headed} contain the relative clause \tit{was er gekocht hat} `what he has stolen'. This is marked in bold in the examples. The (light) head of the relative clause is \tit{das}.
In \ref{ex:extra-headed-base}, the relative clause and its head appear in base position. In \ref{ex:extra-headed-only-clause}, the relative clause is extraposed. This is grammatical, because it is possible to extrapose CPs in Modern German. In \ref{ex:extra-headed-head-clause}, the relative clause and the head are extraposed. This is ungrammatical, because it is possible to extrapose DPs.

\ex.\label{ex:extra-headed}
\ag. Jan hat das, \tbf{was} \tbf{er} \tbf{gekocht} \tbf{hat}, aufgegessen.\\
 Jan has that what he cooked has eaten\\
`Jan has eaten what he cooked.'\label{ex:extra-headed-base}
\bg. Jan hat das aufgegessen, \tbf{was} \tbf{er} \tbf{gekocht} \tbf{hat}.\\
 Jan has that eaten what he cooked has\\
`Jan has eaten what he cooked.'\label{ex:extra-headed-only-clause}
\cg. *Jan hat aufgegessen, das, \tbf{was} \tbf{er} \tbf{gekocht} \tbf{hat}.\\
 Jan has eaten that what he cooked has\\
`Jan has eaten what he cooked.'\label{ex:extra-headed-head-clause} \flushfill{Modern German}

The same can be observed in relative clauses without a head. \ref{ex:extra-headless} is the same sentence as in \ref{ex:extra-headed} only without the overt head. The relative clause is marked in bold again.
In \ref{ex:extra-headless-base}, the relative clause appears in base position. In \ref{ex:extra-headless-clause}, the relative clause is extraposed. This is grammatical, because it is possible to extrapose CPs in Modern German. In \ref{ex:extra-headless-no-rel}, the relative clause is extraposed without the relative pronouns. This is ungrammatical, because the relative pronoun is part of the CP.
This shows that the relative pronoun in headless relatives in Modern German are necessarily part of a CP, which is here a relative clause.

\ex.\label{ex:extra-headless}
\ag. Jan hat \tbf{was} \tbf{er} \tbf{gekocht} \tbf{hat} aufgegessen.\\
Jan has what he cooked has eaten\\
`Jan has eaten what he cooked.'\label{ex:extra-headless-base}
\bg. Jan hat aufgegessen \tbf{was} \tbf{er} \tbf{gekocht} \tbf{hat}.\\
Jan has eaten what he cooked has\\
`Jan has eaten what he cooked.'\label{ex:extra-headless-clause}
\bg. *Jan hat \tbf{was} aufgegessen \tbf{er} \tbf{gekocht} \tbf{hat}.\\
Jan has what eaten he cooked has\\
`Jan has eaten what he cooked.'\label{ex:extra-headless-no-rel}\flushfill{Modern German}

In conclusion, extraposition facts show that the relative pronoun in Modern German is syntactically part of the relative clause. Therefore, the relative pronoun is the internal element in headless relative construction.


\subsection{The other element = external}\label{sec:external-element}

In the previous section I introduced the relative pronoun as the internal element. This means that the other element is the external element. This section starts with the observation that there actually are languages in which two elements surface in so-called double-headed relative clauses. In these languages, the external head is a subset of the internal head, and that some features like \tsc{d} and case are necessarily excluded in the external head. I adopt this insight, and I apply it to the headless relative situation. I propose that the external head in headless relatives is a copy of a specific part of the relative pronoun.%cinque: headless relatives, what is the subset?

As I said earlier, I need two elements to do case competition with. In headless relatives, I only see a single one surfacing. However, some languages actually show two elements surfacing. Here there are two copies of the element, one inside the relative clause, one outside of the relative clause.

\exg. [\tbf{doü} adiyan-o-no] \tbf{doü} deyalukhe\\
 sago give.3\tsc{pl}.\tsc{nonfut}-{tr}-\tsc{conn} sago finished.\tsc{adj}\\
 `The sago that they gave is finished.' \flushfill{Kombai, \pgcitealt{vries1993}{78}}

The external element is not always an exact copy of the element inside of the relative clause. An example from Kombai shows that the element outside of the relative clause can also be a subset of what the element inside of the relative clause is. Here I give two examples, there is an \tit{old man} and a \tit{person}, and there is \tit{pig} and a \tit{thing}.

\ex.
\ag. [\tbf{yare} gamo khereja bogi-n-o] \tbf{rumu} na-momof-a\\
 {old man} join.\ac{ss} work do.\ac{dur}.3\ac{sg}.\ac{nf}-\ac{tr}-\ac{conn} person my-uncle-\ac{pred}\\
 `The old man, who is joining the work, is my uncle.' 77
\bg. [\tbf{ai} fali-khano] \tbf{ro} nagu-n-ay-a.\\
 pig carry-go.3\tsc{pl}.\tsc{nf} thing our-\tsc{tr}-pig-\ac{pred}\\
 `The pig they took away, is ours.' \flushfill{Kombai, \pgcitealt{vries1993}{77}}

Let me now apply what we have seen so far to headless relatives. Headless relatives do not have an overt NP, so this cannot be copied. However, there is the relative pronoun which is specified for number, gender, case, etc. Are all of these features copied onto the external element? The copy is the portion of the nominal extended projection c-commanded by the relative clause. A headless relative is a restrictive relative clause. Therefore, there is no \tsc{d} and no case.

Is it possible to add features onto the external head after it has been copied? Yes, for example D, as the example shows, but also case.

\exg. Junya-wa [Ayaka-ga \tbf{ringo}-o mui-ta] sono \tbf{ringo}-o tabe-ta.\\
Junya-\ac{top} Ayaka-\ac{nom} apple-\ac{acc} peel-\ac{pst} that apple-\ac{acc} eat-\ac{pst}\\
‘Junya ate the apples that Ayaka peeled.’ \flushfill{Japanese, \pgcitealt{erlewine2016}{2}}

In sum, the external element is a copy of a subset of the features of the relative pronoun. Definiteness and case are not copied. New features can be merged onto the external element.

I am not going to give a whole sentence. I only talk about the internal and external element in there. I also do not talk about the nature of the deletion process.

\subsubsection{Relative pronoun}

I give an overview of Old High German relative pronouns. I only give the neuter and masculine gender, because I do not have any examples with the feminine. Relative pronouns consist of three morphemes: a \tit{d}, a vowel (\tit{a}, \tit{e} or \tit{i}) and suffix that differs per number, gender and case.\footnote{
\tit{d} can also be \tit{dh} and \tit{th}, \tit{ë} and \tit{ē} can also be \tit{e} and \tit{é}.

The \tit{d} morpheme corresponds to \tsc{def}.

The ending corresponds to number, gender and case: \tsc{ref}, \tsc{class}, \tsc{masc}, \tsc{ind}, \tsc{group} and \tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2}, \tsc{f3}. Illustrate this with nouns and adjectives.

The vowel corresponds to anaphoricity.
Do they also not appear in adjectives? Is there any anaphoricity?

Now I can specify the lexical entries.

The case etc. morpheme has a binary bottom, because it does not always surface as a suffix (at least in Modern German).

\exg. Ich habe 's Fahrrad vergessen.\\
 I have the\scsub{weak} bike forgotten\\
 `I forgot the bike.'

give nominative singular masculine r
give nominative singular masculine n

give anaphoricity e

give definiteness D How does this relate to being a relative pronoun?

I illustrate how this relative pronoun is built, using the spellout algorithm.

\ex. \tbf{Spellout Algorithm:}\\
Merge F and \label{ex:spellout}
 \a. Spell out FP.
 \b. If (a) fails, attempt movement of the spec of the complement of \tsc{f}, and retry (a).
 \b. If (b) fails, move the complement of \tsc{f}, and retry (a).

When a new match is found, it overrides previous spellouts.

\ex. \tbf{Cyclic Override} \citep{starke2018}:\\
Lexicalisation at a node XP overrides any previous match at a phrase contained in XP.

build build, until we reach anaphoricity

A specifier is constructed.

\ex. \tbf{Spec Formation} \citep{starke2018}:\\
If Merge F has failed to spell out (even after backtracking), try to spawn a new derivation providing the feature F and merge that with the current derivation, projecting the feature F at the top node.\label{ex:specformation}

\ex. Merge F, Move XP, Merge XP

how do I get case features onto the portmanteau? backtracking, open the three things, and see where I can spell it out

If the spellout procedure in \ref{ex:spellout} fails, backtracking takes place.

\ex. \tbf{Backtracking} \citep{starke2018}:\\
When spellout fails, go back to the previous cycle, and try the next option for that cycle.\label{ex:backtracking}

\subsubsection{External element}

I copy the \tsc{ind} and I only merge the cases.

Modern German has two types of demonstratives: the strong one and the weak one.

The strong article is used when there is an anaphoric relation. Often there is a linguistic antecedent that is referred back to.

\exg. Hans hat heute \tbf{einen} \tbf{Freund} zum Essen mit nach Hause gebracht. Er hat uns vorher ein Foto \tbf{vom}/ \tbf{von} \tbf{dem} \tbf{Freund} gezeigt.\\
Hans has today a friend {to the} dinner with to home brought he has us beforehand a photo {of the\scsub{weak}} of the\scsub{strong} friend shown\\
`Hans brought a friend home for dinner today. He had shown us a photo of the friend beforehand.'

Weak articles are used when situational uniqueness is involved. Uniqueness can be global or within a restricted domain. The discourse participants mutually shared knowledge that uniqueness holds.

\ex.
\ag. Der Einbrecher ist {zum Glück} vom /von dem Hund verjagt worden.\\
the burglar is luckily {by the\scsub{weak}} by the\scsub{strong} dog {chased away} been\\
`Luckily, the burglar was chased away by the dog.'
\bg. Armstrong flog als erster zum Mond.\\
Armstrong flew as {first one} {to the\scsub{weak}} moon\\
`Armstrong was the first one to fly to the moon.' \flushfill{Modern German, \pgcitealt{schwarz2009}{40}}

In the headless relatives, there is uniqueness. Show?

The strong article cannot be used because it does not go together with the free choice interpretation of \tsc{wh}-relatives (say something about Hanink).

The weak article is used. accusative:

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{acc}P,
tikz={
\node[label=below:\tit{n},
draw,circle,
scale=0.85,

    [\tsc{f}2]
    [\tsc{nom}P
        [\tsc{f1}]
        [\tsc{ind}P
            [\phantom{xxx},
            roof
            ]
        ]
    ]
]
\end{forest}

nominative:

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{nom}P,
tikz={
\node[label=below:\tit{r},
draw,circle,
scale=0.85,
fit to=tree]{};
}
    [\tsc{f1}]
    [\tsc{ind}P
        [\phantom{xxx},
        roof
        ]
    ]
]
\end{forest}

the internal case is more complex than the external case, and the internal base part is more complex than the external non-cas part

\subsection{Deriving `matching'}

Radek: Czech distinguishes between accidental uniqueness and inherent uniqueness. Accidental uniqueness: with \tsc{dem}, inherent uniqueness: without \tsc{dem}.

Radek's situation:

Two student assistants A and B are at their shared workdesk, which they share with other student assistants and where there’s a computer and a couple of other things, including a book (it doesn’t really matter to whom the book belongs). A is looking for a pencil, B says

\exg. Nějaká tužka je vedle {počítače /\#toho počítače}.\\
some pencil is {next to} computer \tsc{dem} computer\\
`There’s a pencil next to the computer.'

All situations like the topic situation – A and B’s shared office (desk)– have exactly one computer in it.

\exg. Nějaká tužka je vedle {té knížky /\#knížky}\\
some pencil is {next to} \tsc{dem} book book\\
`There’s a pencil next to the book.'

There is exactly one book in the topic situation – A and B’s shared office (desk) – and it does not hold that all situation like the topic situation have exactly one book in it

Florian showed that this is different for Modern German:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
\toprule
       & anaphoric                & situational uniqueness              & inherent uniqueness                 \\
       \cmidrule{2-4}
Polish & \cellcolor{DG}\tsc{dem}  & \cellcolor{DG}\tsc{dem}             & ∅                                   \\
German & \tsc{dem}\scsub{strong}  & \cellcolor{LG}\tsc{dem}\scsub{weak} & \cellcolor{LG}\tsc{dem}\scsub{weak} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Excluding `non-matching --- external-only'}









\section{Alternative analyses}\label{sec:alternative-analyses}

\subsection{Himmelreich}

She specific languages for having different types of agree (up, down) and different types of probes (active, non-active). Doing that, she successfully derived free relatives and parasitic gaps in different languages.

\subsection{Grosu}

Grosu 1994 linked richness of inflection to liberality. He actually talked about the richness of pro.

\subsection{Grafting story}

For this pattern a single element analysis seems intuitive, if you assume that case is complex and that syntax works bottom-up. First you built the relative clause, with the big case in there. Then you build the main clause and you let the more complex case in the embedded clause license the main clause predicate.

Consider the example in \ref{ex:mg-nom-acc-grafting}. Here the internal case is accusative and the external one nominative.

\exg. Uns besucht \tbf{wen} \tbf{Maria} \tbf{mag}.\\
 we.\ac{acc} visit.3\ac{sg}\scsub{[nom]} \tsc{rel}.\ac{acc}.\tsc{an} Maria.\ac{nom} like.3\ac{sg}\scsub{[acc]}\\
 `Who visits us, Maria likes.' \flushfill{adapted from \pgcitealt{vogel2001}{343}}\label{ex:mg-nom-acc-grafting}

The relative clause is built, including the accusative relative pronoun. Now the main clause predicate can merge with the nominative that is contained within the accusative.

 \ex.
 \begin{forest} boom
	 [,name=src, s sep=15mm
			[VP
			 		[\tit{besucht}, roof]
			]
		 	[,no edge, s sep=20mm
	       [\ac{acc}P,
				 tikz={
				 \node[label=below:\tit{wen},
				 draw,circle,
				 scale=0.85,
				 fit to=tree]{};
				 }
	           [\tsc{f2}]
	           [\tsc{nomP},name=tgt
	               [\tsc{f1}]
	               [XP
	                   [\phantom{xxx}, roof]
	               ]
	           ]
	       ]
				 [VP
				 		 [\tit{Maria mag}, roof]
				 ]
			]
	 ]
	 \draw (src) to[out=south east,in=north east] (tgt);
 \end{forest}\label{ex:acc-nom-grafting}

The other way around does not work. Consider \ref{ex:mg-acc-nom-grafting}. This is an example with nominative as internal case and accusative as external case.

\exg. *Ich {lade ein}, wen \tbf{mir} \tbf{sympathisch} \tbf{ist}.\\
I.\ac{nom} invite.1\ac{sg}\scsub{[acc]} \tsc{rel}.\ac{acc}.\tsc{an} I.\ac{dat} nice be.3\ac{sg}\scsub{[nom]}\\
`I invite who I like.' \flushfill{adapted from \pgcitealt{vogel2001}{344}}\label{ex:mg-acc-nom-grafting}

Now the relative clause is built first again, this time only including the nominative case. There is no accusative node to merge with for the external predicate. Instead, the relative pronoun would need to grow to accusative somehow and then the merge could take place. This is the desired result, because the sentence is ungrammatical.

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
  [,name=src, s sep=15mm
     [VP
         [\tit{lade ein}, roof]
     ]
         [,no edge
    			[\tsc{nomP},
    			tikz={
    			\node[label=below:\tit{wer},
    			draw,circle,
    			scale=0.85,
    			fit to=tree]{};
    			}
    					[\tsc{f1}]
    					[XP
    							[\phantom{xxx}, roof]
    					]
    			]
    			[VP
    					[\tit{mir sympatisch ist}, roof]
    			]
    	 ]
    ]
\end{forest}\label{ex:nom-acc-grafting}

So, this seems to work fine. The assumptions you have to do in order to make this are the following. First, case is complex. Second, you can remerge an embedded node (grafting). For the first one I have argued in Chapter \ref{ch:decomposition}. The second one could use some additional argumentation. It is a mix between internal remerge (move) and external merge, namely external remerge. Other literature on multidominance and grafting, other phenomena. Problems: linearization, .. But even if fix all these theoretical problems, there is an empirical one.

That is, I want to connect this behavior of Modern German headless relatives to the shape of its relative pronouns. These pronouns are \tsc{wh}-elements. The OHG and Gothic ones are not \tsc{wh}, they are \tsc{d}. Their relative pronouns look different, and so their headless relatives can also behave differently.
