Anke and Johannes

During my three years as a PhD-student I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to visit the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and the Masaryk University in Brno (twice). Thank you for giving me the chance to come and for the inspiration and ideas I got during my stays.
I presented my work at
ConSOLE XXVI in London,
The 42nd Penn Linguistics Conference in Philadeplhia,
GLOW 41 in Budapest,
the 28th Colloquium on Generative Grammar in Tarragona,
On the place of case in grammar (PlaCiG) in Rethymnon and
the Exploring Nanosyntax workshop at the LSA annual meeting in New York.
I am grateful to the participants of these conferences and workshops for their helpful comments and questions.
I am also grateful for the opportunity to present my work at colloquia at Universität Leipzig and at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen and for the feedback I received there.

I also want to thank the Nanosyntax community for creating such a nice environment to do linguistics in.
The nanolabs and lecture series always keep me inspired and motivated.
I especially thank
