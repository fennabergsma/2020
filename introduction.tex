\chapter{Introduction}

The topic of this thesis is case attraction in headless relative clauses.

\section{Case attraction}

normal headed relatives, cases can differ
in most languages, element takes case of its clause
see here an example of modern german.


in other languages (mostly ancient, but also modern Greek) cases do not match within their clauses, but they match with each other.
relative pronoun takes case from the NP in the main clause: case attraction
example from old high german

there is a generalization here: more complex case wins


\section{Headless relatives}

proper attraction headless
inverse attraction headless



\section{The variation}
