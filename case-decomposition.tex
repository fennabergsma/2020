\chapter{Case decomposition}

At the beginning of the previous chapter I showed that the case scale \tsc{nom < acc < dat} appears in headless relatives. In most accounts for headless relatives (\citealt[cf.][]{pittner1995,vogel2001,grosu2003,harbert1978}, an exception to this is \citealt{himmelreich2017}) the case scale is stipulated. Headless relatives simply obey to that hierarchy. \pgcitet{pittner1995}{201:fn.4} makes this explicit: ``One of the reviewers notes that an explanation in terms of a Case hierarchy is rather stipulative. However, as far as I know, nobody has suggested a nonstipulative explanation for these facts.''

What I showed as well in the previous chapter is the case scale \tsc{nom < acc < dat} is a wide-spread phenomenon: it recurs. The scale can be observed in at least two more syntactic phenomena: agreement en relativization.\footnote{
In this dissertation I do not work out accounts for these two syntactic phenomena. They merely serve as an illustration that the pattern is reflected in other syntactic phenomena as well.}
The case scale also appears within morphology in syncretism patterns and formal containment. \pgcitet{pittner1995}{201:fn.4} makes this link to morphology as well: ``Furthermore, the Case hierarchies receive some independent support by morphology as shown by the various inflectional paradigms.''

I am not after a theory in which the case hierarchy is not something construction specific, and syntax and morphology both have their own case hierarchy. I argue that there is a single trigger that is responsible for the case scale in different subparts of language \citep[cf.][on numeral constructions]{caha2019}. Specifically, I show that the observed case scale naturally follows on the assumption that the case hierarchy is deeply anchored in syntax. The case scale in morphology and syntax are merely reflexes of how case is organized in language.\footnote{
\citet{himmelreich2017} works this intuition out in a different way.
}

This chapter is structured as follows. First, I introduce a specific case decomposition \citep{caha2009}. In the next two sections, I show how this case decomposition is able to derive the syncretism and formal containment facts from the previous chapter. I make this concrete in the framework Nanosyntax \citep{starke2009}. Finally, I show how the case decomposition translates to the case scale observed in headless relatives.


\section{The basic idea}

\citet{caha2009,caha2013} (followed by \citealt[cf.][]{starke2009,bobaljik2012,mcfadden2018,smith2019,vanbaal2018}) has extensively argued that case should be decomposed into privative features. Specifically, the decomposition is cumulative: each case has a different number of case features, and the number grows monotonically.
This is illustrated in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. Accusative has all the features that nominative has (here \tsc{f}1) plus one extra (here \tsc{f}2). Dative has all the features accusative has (\tsc{f} and \tsc{f}2) plus one extra (\tsc{f}3).

\begin{table}[ht]
  \center
	\caption {Case decomposed}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    case      & features                      \\
    \midrule
    \tsc{nom} & \tsc{f}1                      \\
    \tsc{acc} & \tsc{f}1, \tsc{f}2            \\
    \tsc{dat} & \tsc{f}1, \tsc{f}2, \tsc{f}3  \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:case-decomposed}
\end{table}

So, the case scale, repeated in \ref{ex:case-scale-derive}, actually indicates containment.
Nominative corresponds to a set of features (namely \tsc{f1}) that is contained in the set of features of accusative (which is namely \tsc{f1} and \tsc{f2}).
Similarly, nominative corresponds to a set of features that is contained in the set of features of dative (which is namely vs. \tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2} and \tsc{f3}).
Lastly, accusative corresponds to a set of features (\tsc{f1} and \tsc{f2}) that is contained in the set of features of dative (\tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2} and \tsc{f3}).

\ex. \ac{nom} < \ac{acc} < \ac{dat}\label{ex:case-scale-derive}

The decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} forms the basis to derive the case scale effects observed in the previous chapter. The next sections show how case containment and syncretism effects follow naturally. After that, I show how the decomposition also derives the case competition facts in headless relatives.


\section{Deriving syncretism}\label{sec:syncretism}

Case syncretism follows the ordering of the case scale in headless relatives: \ac{nom} < \ac{acc} < \ac{dat}. Along this scale, only contiguous regions in the sequence are syncretic. In this section I show how case syncretism patterns can be derived from the case decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. I repeat an example that shows the possible and impossible syncretism patterns in Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \center
  \caption {Syncretism pattern}
    \input{tables/syncretism-nom-acc-dat.tex}
  \label{tbl:syncretisms-derive}
\end{table}

The syncretism facts follow in a system in which the case is decomposed as in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} and in which lexicalization that relies on containment. That means that a phonological form is not only inserted if a particular feature specification matches, but also when the features form a subset of the particular feature set.

The intuition is the following. Syncretic forms are realized by a single lexical entry from the lexicon. A lexical entry can be applied if it contains all features, as long as there is no more specific one. So, a lexical entry specified for [\tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2}, \tsc{f3}] can also apply to [\tsc{f1}], if there is no other lexical entry. Now, if there is an entry specific for only [\tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2}].

GO TRHOUGH ALL POSSIBLITES?

% If different cases in a paradigm are syncretic, they can be stored as a single form in the lexicon. That is, Dutch only has a single form in its lexicon for \tit{jullie}. This form is carries \tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2} and \tsc{f3} (see Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}). In the framework I will be using (Nanosyntax), lexical items apply to feature sets based on containment. \tsc{f1} and \tsc{f2} are contained in the set of \tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2} and \tsc{f3}.

% This last example also illustrates that the laid out system is unable to derive an ABA pattern. The unability of the system to derive such a pattern is a welcome one, since the pattern is unattested cross-linguistically. In an ABA pattern, the nominative and the dative are syncretic, to the exclusion of the accusative. Staying close to the German example, in this hypothetical example, the dative would be \tit{ihr}, the accusative \tit{sie}, and the nominative \tit{ihr} again.
% This result could never be derived with the lexical entries given in \ref{ex:german-sie-lexicon} and \ref{ex:german-ihr-lexicon}. \tit{Ihr} is inserted for the dative and the cases contained in it (so accusative and nominative), unless a more specific lexical entry is found. \tit{Sie} is the more specific lexical entry that is found from the accusative on. From the accusative on, \tit{sie} will be inserted until a more specific entry is found. If no entry is specified for nominative, \tit{sie} will surface. \tit{Ihr} will not resurface, because the lexical entry for \tit{sie} will remain to be more specific.

 % The morphological form of the pronouns mirror the cumulative feature decomposition given in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. That is, the accusative has the morphology that the nominative has (\tit{luw}) plus something extra (\tit{-e:l}). The dative has the morphology that the accusative has (\tit{luw-e:l}) plus something extra (\tit{luw-e:l}-na). In what follows I make it concrete how syntactic features translate to morphological form.


The proposal in this dissertation is worked out in Nanosyntax. I provide background assumptions on the framework whenever necessary to follow the discussion as I proceed. At this point I discuss the general architecture of Nanosyntax, its lexicon, phrasal spellout and matching between syntax and the lexicon.

The architecture of Nanosyntax is schematically shown in Figure \ref{fig:nano} \citep[from][]{vandenwyngaerd2020,caha2019}. In Nanosyntax, syntax starts with atomic features, and it builds complex syntactic trees. Specifically, there are no `feature bundles' that enter the syntax. The only way complex feature structures come to exist is a a result of merge.
After syntax (actually, each instance of merge), the syntactic structure is matched against the lexicon for pronunciation. The lexicon `translates' between syntactic representations on the one hand and phonology (PF) and concepts (CF) on the other hand. So, Nanosyntax is a late insertion model: (lexical) insertion takes place late, namely after syntax.

      \path [line] (lexicon) -- (cf);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Nanosyntactic model of grammar}
  \label{fig:nano}
\end{figure}

In Nanosyntax, the lexicon is nothing but links between syntactic representations, phonological representations and conceptual representations \citep{starke2014}.\footnote{
The syntactic representation does not have to correspond to both a phonological and a conceptual representation. Syntactic representation that only correspond to a conceptual representations and not to phonological representations are (phrasal or clausal) idioms. Syntactic representations that only correspond to phonological representations but not to conceptual representations are for instance irregular plurals.
}
I leave the conceptual representation out of discussion for now, as it not relevant for the discussion here. The fact that only syntax can create complex feature structures also has a consequence for the content of the lexicon.
Syntactic structures are constrained by certain principles, such that only well-formed syntactic structures exist. Since the lexical items from the lexicon link syntactic representation to phonological and conceptual representation, these syntactic representations are constrained by the same principles as syntactic trees are. As a result, the lexicon only contains well-formed syntactic structures. The lexicon does not contain unstructured `feature bundles', because they could never be created by syntax.

Following this logic, the syntactic representation for a lexical entry as in \ref{ex:feature-set} cannot exist. The feature bundle cannot have entered syntax, because syntax starts with atomic features. It can also not be created by syntax, because complex structures can only be created with merge.

\ex. [ \tsc{f}1, \tsc{f}2, \tsc{f}3 ]\label{ex:feature-set}

Instead, a possible syntactic representation for a lexical entry looks as in \ref{ex:feature-structure}. The features are merged one by one in a binary syntactic structure.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{dat}P
      [\ac{f}3]
      [\ac{acc}P
          [\ac{f}2]
          [\ac{f}1]
      ]
  ]
\end{forest}\label{ex:feature-structure}

This structure leads to the concept of phrasal spellout: not terminals but multiple syntactic heads (phrases) are realized with a single piece of phonology (i.e. a single morpheme). A necessary requirement is that these multiple syntactic heads form a constituent.

Let me illustrate all of the above with the Faroese pronouns from Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive}. I simplify the situation in two respects. First, I do not show the internal complexity of the pronouns, including person and number features. Instead, I give a triangle, indicating that this is a complex syntactic structure. I refer to is as the person-number phase it refers to, so e.g. \tsc{3sg}P. Second, in this simplified representation I consider the Faroese pronouns to be monomorphemic. I ignore the fact that all three pronouns clearly have the stem \tit{t} with a suffix on it.

The lexical entry for \tit{tú} is given in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon}. The syntactic representation consists of the complex syntactic structure that corresponds to the third person singular pronoun (the \tsc{3sg}P), and \tsc{f}1, making it a \tsc{nom}P. The phonological representation that is linked to the syntactic representation in \tit{tú}. Throughout the dissertation, I use syntactic structures and phonological forms connected by a double arrow (⇔) to refer to a lexical entry.

The lexical entry for \tit{teg} is given in \ref{ex:faroese-teg-lexicon}. The syntactic representation contains all the features of the syntactic structure in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon}, plus \tsc{f}2, making it an \tsc{acc}P. The linked phonological representation is \tit{teg}.

The lexical entry for \tit{tær} is given in \ref{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon}. The syntactic representation contains all the features of the syntactic structure in \ref{ex:faroese-teg-lexicon}, plus \tsc{f}3, making it an \tsc{dat}P. The linked phonological representation is \tit{tær}.

\label{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon}

This brings me to the part of the discussion about matching. The syntactic structures and their phonological counterparts I gave in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon} to \ref{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon} are lexical entries. These are matched against the actual syntactic structure that is to be realized.
Examples of syntactic structures are given in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-spellout} to \ref{ex:faroese-taer-spellout}.
The syntactic structure in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-spellout} matches the syntactic structure of the lexical entry in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon}. Therefore, this syntactic structure is spelled out as \tit{tu}. Throughout this dissertation I circle the part of the structure that corresponds to a particular lexical entry, and I place the corresponding phonology under it.

\end{forest}
\label{ex:faroese-taer-spellout}

In the Faroese examples above, the syntactic structure in the syntax always exactly matched the syntactic structure of the lexical entry. However, to be a successful match, identity is not a necessary requirement. Instead, matching relies on a containment relation. A lexical entry applies when it contains all features. This is formalized as in \ref{ex:superset-principle}.

\ex. \tbf{The Superset Principle} \citet{starke2009}:\\
A lexically stored tree matches a syntactic node iff the lexically stored tree contains the syntactic node.
\label{ex:superset-principle}

Let me illustrate this with the Dutch second person plural pronoun from Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive}. This pronoun is syncretic between between the nominative, accusative and dative.
The lexicon only contains a single lexical entry, namely \ref{ex:dutch-jullie-lexicon}. The syntactic representation consists of the complex syntactic structure that corresponds to the second person plural pronoun (the \tsc{2pl}P), and \tsc{f}1, \tsc{f2} and \tsc{f3} making it a \tsc{dat}P. The phonological representation that is linked to the syntactic representation in \tit{jullie}.
The nominative, the accusative and the dative can all be spelled out with this lexical entry.

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{dat}P
      [\ac{f}3]

\end{forest}
\label{ex:dutch-jullie-lexicon}

The syntactic structure of the dative, given in \ref{ex:dutch-jullie-spellout-dat}, is the least exciting of the three. It is an exact match to the syntactic structure in the lexical entry \ref{ex:dutch-jullie-lexicon}, and therefore, spelled out as \tit{jullie}.

This syntactic structure does not exactly match the syntactic structure in the lexical entry in \ref{ex:dutch-jullie-lexicon}. However, the syntactic structure in the lexical entry contains the syntactic structure of the accusative.

A question arises at this point. Why are the accusative and nominative in Faroese not spelled out by the lexical entry for the dative (and why is the nominative not spelled out by the lexical entry for the accusative)? These syntactic structures are namely contained in the lexical entry for the dative (and the accusative).
The reason for that comes from how competition between lexical entries is regulated in Nanosyntax. When two lexical entries compete, the best fit wins. The best fit is the lexical entry with the least unused features. This is formalized as in \ref{ex:elsewhere-condition}.

\ex. \tbf{The Elsewhere Condition} (\citealt{kiparsky1973}, formulated as in \citealt{caha2020}):\\
When two entries can spell out a given node, the more specific entry wins. Under the Superset Principle governed insertion, the more specific entry is the one which has fewer unused features.
\label{ex:elsewhere-condition}

I show how the Superset Principle and the Elswhere Condition interact in a competition with the Faroese lexical entries.
Consider first again the syntactic structure for the nominative in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-spellout}.
All the Faroese lexical entries \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon}, \ref{ex:faroese-teg-lexicon} and \ref{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon} contain the syntactic structure for it.
\ref{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon} has two unused features: \tsc{f2} and \tsc{f3}. \ref{ex:faroese-teg-lexicon} has one unused feature: \tsc{f2}. \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon} has the least amount of unused features (namely zero), so it wins the competition over the other two.

Regarding the syntactic structure for the accusative in \ref{ex:faroese-teg-spellout}, the lexical entries \ref{ex:faroese-teg-lexicon} and \ref{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon} contain the syntactic structure.
\ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon} is not a candidate here, because it does not contain the syntactic structure (i.e. it lacks \tsc{f2}). \ref{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon} has fewer unused features than \ref{ex:faroese-teg-spellout}, so it wins.

Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive} contains two more attested patterns: the ABB in Icelandic and the AAB in German. In the remainder of this section I show how these two patterns are derived. I also how the system is unable to derive an ABA, which is crosslinguistically unattested.

Consider the Icelanic pattern. For the first person plural, Icelandic uses \tit{við} as nominative and \tit{okkur} as accusative and dative. Two lexical entries are needed for that. The first one in \ref{ex:icelandic-vid-lexicon} contain pronominal syntactic structure and \tsc{f}1, and corresponds to the phonology \tit{við}.
The second one is given in \ref{ex:icelandic-okkur-lexicon}. It contains in addition to \ref{ex:icelandic-vid-lexicon} also the feature \tsc{f}2 and \tsc{f}3. The phonological representation that is linked to it is \tit{okkur}.

This last example also illustrates that the laid out system is unable to derive an ABA pattern. The unability of the system to derive such a pattern is a welcome one, since the pattern is unattested cross-linguistically. In an ABA pattern, the nominative and the dative are syncretic, to the exclusion of the accusative. Such a language would be like German but then the nominative would be \tit{ihr} instead of \tit{sie}.

This result could never be derived with the lexical entries given in \ref{ex:german-sie-lexicon} and \ref{ex:german-ihr-lexicon}. \tit{Ihr} is inserted for the dative and the cases contained in it (so accusative and nominative), unless a more specific lexical entry is found. \tit{Sie} is the more specific lexical entry that is found from the accusative on. From the accusative on, \tit{sie} will be inserted until a more specific entry is found. If no entry is specified for nominative, \tit{sie} will surface. \tit{Ihr} will not resurface, because the lexical entry for \tit{sie} will remain to be more specific.

\section{Deriving case containment}

In for instance Khanty, the phonological form of the accusative literally contains the phonological form of the nominative. In turn, the form of the dative contains the form of the accusative. In this section I show how morphological case containment can be derived from the case decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. I repeat an example from Khanty that shows morphological case containment in Table \ref{tbl:cont-khanty} \pgcitep{nikolaeva1999}{16}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \center
  \caption {Containment in \tsc{3sg} in Khanty}
    \input{tables/containment-nom-acc-dat.tex}
  \label{tbl:cont-khanty-3sg}
\end{table}

The intuition is the following. The morphological form of the pronouns mirror the cumulative feature decomposition given in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. That is, the accusative has the morphology that the nominative has (\tit{luw}) plus something extra (\tit{-e:l}). The dative has the morphology that the accusative has (\tit{luw-e:l}) plus something extra (\tit{luw-e:l}-na). In what follows I make it concrete how syntactic features translate to morphological form.

First, I give the lexical entry for the nominative third person singular. It contains pronominal syntactic structure and the feature \tsc{f}1. The phonological form associated with the structure is \tit{luw}. The lexical entry is given in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-lexicon}.

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{nom}P
      [\tsc{f1}]
      [3\ac{sg}P
          [\phantom{xxx}, roof]
      ]
  ]
  {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{luw}}; }
\end{forest}\label{ex:khanty-luw-lexicon}

The syntactic structure in for the nominative is given in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-spellout}. It is contained in the syntactic structure of the lexical entry in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-spellout}, and the nominative is spelled out as \tit{luw}.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{nomP},
tikz={
\node[label=below:\tit{luw},
draw,circle,
scale=0.8,
fit to=tree]{};
}
    [\tsc{f1}]
    [\tsc{3sg}P
        [\phantom{xxx}, roof]
    ]
]
\end{forest}\label{ex:khanty-luw-spellout}

In the previous section I only gave examples in which the forms were syncretic (i.e. formally identical) or suppletive (i.e. formally unrelated). All (pronoiminal and case) features were spelled out by a single lexical entry. The examples from Khanty are different. The accusative pronoun formally contains the nominative pronoun. This can be modeled by letting the \tsc{nom}P contained in the \tsc{acc}P be realized by the same \tsc{nom}P that is spelled out in the nominative. \tsc{f2} has their own realization that builds upon the nominative (and so does \tsc{f3} on top of the accusative).\footnote{
Note that it is crucial here to have a theory in which the features that form an accusative contain the features that form a nominative. If not, it would be a surprise that the nominative form is contained in the accusative form. The same holds for the accusative and dative.
}

Accordingly, I give the lexical entry for the accusative marker \tit{-e:l} in \ref{ex:khanty-el-lexicon}.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{acc}P
      [\tsc{f2}]
  ]
  {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{-e:l}}; }
\end{forest}\label{ex:khanty-el-lexicon}

So, \tit{luw-e:l} consists of two morphemes that both correspond to their own piece of syntactic structure: \tit{luw} and \tit{e:l}. But how do these two morphemes combine? This issue brings me to another detour into the Nanosyntactic theory, which is about spellout driven movement.

As discussed in the previous section, spellout in Nanosyntax only targets constituents. That means that it is impossible to let \tsc{accP} spell out as \tit{e:l} while it contains \tsc{nom}P.\footnote{Notice that this also gives the incorrect order of the morphemes: \tit{e:l-luw} instead of \tit{luw-e:l}.}

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\ac{acc}P,name=accp, s sep=20mm,

}
    [\tsc{f2},name=acc]
    [\tsc{nomP},
    tikz={
    \node[label=below:\tit{luw},
    draw,circle,
    scale=0.8,
    fit to=tree]{};
    }
        [\tsc{f1}]
        [3\tsc{sg}P
            [\phantom{xxx}, roof]
        ]
    ]
]
\end{forest}
\label{ex:khanty-el-luw-spellout}

The lexical entry in \ref{ex:khanty-el-lexicon} can only be a match for the syntactic structure if \tsc{nomP} moves away, leaving the \tsc{accP} containing \tsc{f2} behind. In other words, the complement of \tsc{f2} needs to be moved away.

Exactly this movement is one of the two so-called `evacuation movements' that is part of the spellout procedure in Nanosyntax. As I illustrated in Section \ref{sec:syncretism}, lexical entries are matched using the Superset Principle and the Elsewhere Condition. However, if there is no match in the lexicon for a particular syntactic structure, two types of movement can take place, in a fixed order.\footnote{
The two movement types are Cinque's complement and spec to spec movement that we need anyway to get different surface orders in our syntax.
}
The movement types change the syntactic structure in such a way that they generate new constituents that are possible matches for spellout.\footnote{
This type of movement is different from syntactic movement. It is driven by spellout, it does not have any interpretational effects, and it does not leave any traces. In Section XX I discuss `regular' syntactic movement in Nanosyntax.
}
For the discussion in this section, only the second type of movement is relevant: complement movement. In this type of movement, the complement or a particular feature moves to the specifier of that same particular feature.

This is exactly the type of movement I described necessary for the Khanty pronoun. The movement is displayed in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-el-movement}. The complement of \tsc{f2}, the \tsc{nom}P, the lower right circled portion in the structure, moves to the specifier of \tsc{acc}P. In its landing position the internal structure of the \tsc{nom}P is no longer shown (taking away the necessity for the circle), and its phonological form is places under the triangle. The strikethrough of the lower \tsc{nom}P indicates that the complement of \tsc{f}2 disappears.

Just as Khanty has an additional morpheme that shows up in the accusative, it also has a morpheme that shows up in the dative. This morpheme \tit{-na} combines with the phonological form for the accusative, which leads to the lexical entry given in \ref{ex:khanty-na-lexicon}.

\section{Deriving the case scale in headless relatives}

In headless relatives, the internal case and the external case compete to surface on the relative pronoun. The two competing cases adhere to the case scale \tsc{nom} < \tsc{acc} < \tsc{dat}, in which cases more to the right always win over cases more to the left. In this section I show how case competition in headless relatives can be derived from the case decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}.

I repeat the summary of the data pattern for Gothic in Table \ref{tbl:summary-gothic-deriving}. I gave the cells different shadings depending on which cases compete. The dark gray cells are the ones in which dative and the accusative compete, and the dative wins. The light gray cells are the ones in which the dative and the nominative compete, and the dative again wins. The uncolored cells are the ones in which the accusative and the nominative compete, and the accusative wins.

The intuition is the following. The headless relatives reflect the cumulative feature decomposition given in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. A case wins the competition if it contains all features the other case has. So, the dative contains all features that the accusative has, so the dative surfaces. Similarly, the dative contains all features the nominative has, and again the dative surfaces. The same holds for the last pair: the accusative contains all features the nominative has, so the accusative surfaces. I illustrate this per case pair.

I start with the competition between dative and accusative, in which dative wins. The corresponding cells are marked dark gray in Table \ref{tbl:summary-gothic-deriving}. In \ref{ex:dat-contains-acc} I show the syntactic structure of a dative relative pronoun. It contains the syntactic features for a relative pronoun, \tsc{f1}, \tsc{f2} and \tsc{f3}. Contained in this structure is an accusative relative pronoun, marked in gray. This consists of the syntactic features for the relative pronoun, \tsc{f1} and \tsc{f2}.

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
  [\tsc{datP}
      [\tsc{f3}]
        [\ac{acc}P,
        tikz={
        \node[draw,circle,transparent,
        fill=DG,fill opacity=0.2,
        scale=0.825,
        fit to=tree]{};

So now, if there is a competition, and both of them are there, the bigger one can delete the smaller one. I am not talking about the exact deletion mechanism here, I will come back to that later.

\section{Summary}

Case can be decomposed cumulatively. Then in a nanosyntax fashion: each feature is a syntactic head. This can derive syncretism facts and formal containment fact. Also: case scale in headless relatives: a case more to the right on the scale contains the case more to the left on the scale, and it can be licensed in that way. The question: is it deleted or was it there never to begin with will be addressed later.
