\chapter{Case decomposition}\label{ch:decomposition}

This chapter provides a theory that derives the first aspect of case competition in headless relatives that I discuss in this dissertation.
This theory seeks to capture that headless relatives crosslinguistically adhere to the case scale \tsc{nom} < \tsc{acc} < \tsc{dat}.

In most existing accounts for case competition in headless relatives (\citealt[cf.][]{pittner1995,vogel2001,grosu2003,harbert1978}, an exception to this is \citealt{himmelreich2017}) the case scale is stipulated. Headless relatives are said to simply obey to that scale. \pgcitet{pittner1995}{fn.4} makes this explicit: ``One of the reviewers notes that an explanation in terms of a Case hierarchy is rather stipulative. However, as far as I know, nobody has suggested a nonstipulative explanation for these facts.''

In the previous chapter I showed that the case scale \ac{nom} < \ac{acc} < \ac{dat} is not specific to headless relatives, but it is a wide-spread phenomenon: it can also be observed in morphology (and in syntax).

Within morphology it appears in syncretism patterns and morphological case containment. \pgcitet{pittner1995}{201:fn.4} makes this link to morphology as well: ``Furthermore, the Case hierarchies receive some independent support by morphology as shown by the various inflectional paradigms.''

As I already eluded to in the summary of Chapter \ref{ch:introduction}, I am not after a theory in which the case scale is something construction-specific, or one in which syntax and morphology both have their own case scale. Instead, argue that there is a single trigger that is responsible for the case scales in different subparts of language (which is identical to what \citealt{caha2019} suggests for case competition in numeral phrases). Specifically, I show that the observed case scale naturally follows on the assumption that the case scale is deeply anchored in syntax. The case scales in morphology and syntax are merely reflexes of how case is organized in the linguistic system.\footnote{
\citet{himmelreich2017} works this intuition out in a different way.
}

This chapter is structured as follows. First, I introduce a specific cumulative case decomposition \citep{caha2009}. In the two following sections, I show how this case decomposition is able to derive the syncretism and morphological case containment facts from Chapter \ref{ch:recurring}. I make this concrete in the framework Nanosyntax \citep{starke2009}. Finally, I show how the case decomposition relates to the winner in case competition in headless relatives.


\section{The basic idea}

\citet{caha2009,caha2013} (followed by \citealt[cf.][]{starke2009,bobaljik2012,mcfadden2018,smith2019,vanbaal2018}) has extensively argued that case should be decomposed into privative features. Specifically, the decomposition is cumulative: each case has a different number of case features, and the number grows one by one.
This is illustrated in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. Accusative has all the features that nominative has (here \tsc{k}1) plus one extra (here \tsc{k}2). Dative has all the features accusative has (\tsc{k}1 and \tsc{k}2) plus one extra (\tsc{k}3).

\begin{table}[H]
  \center
	\caption {Cumulative case decomposition}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    case      & features                  \\
    \midrule
    \ac{nom} & \tsc{k}1                    \\
    \ac{acc} & \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2           \\
    \ac{dat} & \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2, \tsc{k}3  \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:case-decomposed}
\end{table}

Consider the case scale, repeated in repeated in \ref{ex:case-scale-derive}.

\ex. \ac{nom} < \ac{acc} < \ac{dat}\label{ex:case-scale-derive}

This scale actually indicates containment.
Nominative corresponds to a set of features (\tsc{k}1) that is contained in the set of features of accusative (\tsc{k}1 and \tsc{k}2).
Similarly, nominative corresponds to a set of features that is contained in the set of features of dative (\tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3).
Lastly, accusative corresponds to a set of features (\tsc{k}1 and \tsc{k}2) that is contained in the set of features of dative (\tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3).

The decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} forms the basis to derive the case scale effects observed in Chapter \ref{ch:recurring}. The following sections show how morphological case containment and syncretism effects follow naturally. After that, I show how the decomposition also derives the case competition facts in headless relatives.


\section{Deriving syncretism}\label{sec:syncretism}

Case syncretism follows the ordering of the case scale. Along this scale, only contiguous regions in the sequence are syncretic. In this section I show how case syncretism patterns can be derived from the case decomposition shown in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}.
In Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive} I repeat the examples that shows the possible and impossible syncretism patterns.

\begin{table}[H]
  \center
  \caption {Syncretism patterns in Germanic pronouns (repeated)}
    \input{tables/syncretism-nom-acc-dat.tex}
  \label{tbl:syncretisms-derive}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive} shows that if one orders cases in the linear sequence \ac{nom} --- \ac{acc} --- \ac{dat}, only contiguous regions in the sequence turn out to be syncretic. First, all three cases can be non-syncretic, as in Faroese. Second, all three cases can be syncretic, as in Dutch. Third, the accusative and the dative can be syncretic and the nominative not, as in Icelandic. Fourth, nominative and accusative can be syncretic and the dative not, as in German. The pattern that is not attested crosslinguistically is the one that targets non-contiguous regions in the table, the ABA pattern \citep{baerman2005,caha2009,zompi2017}.

The syncretism facts follow in a system in which the case is decomposed as in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} and in which lexicalization relies on containment. The latter means that a phonological form is not only inserted when the lexical specification is identical to the syntax, but also when the syntactic features are a subset of the lexical specification. The intuition is the following. Syncretic forms are realized by a single `lexical entry' from the `lexicon'. I elaborate on the terms lexical entry and lexicon shortly.
A lexical entry can be applied if it contains all features, as long as there is no more specific one. This system can generate the patterns ABC, AAA, ABB and AAB, but not ABA.

Before I show how the four attested patterns can be derived (and the unattested one cannot), I need to make some theoretical assumptions explicit about Nanosyntax, the framework in which this dissertation is worked out. First, I show how the Nanosyntactic system is set up in such a way that morphological patterns (like syncretism, but also morphological containment) can inform us about the way syntax is structured. Therefore, I briefly discuss the general architecture of Nanosyntax, its postsyntactic lexicon, and the content and shape of lexical entries. Lastly, I discuss how multiple features (like \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3 from Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}) can be spelled out by a single phonological element using phrasal spellout.

In Nanosyntax, syntax starts with atomic features, and it builds complex syntactic trees. Specifically, there are no `feature bundles' (from a pre-syntactic lexicon) that enter the syntax. The only way complex feature structures come to exist is a result of merge.
After syntax (actually, each instance of merge), the syntactic structure is matched against the lexicon for pronunciation. The lexicon `translates' between lexical trees (i.e. syntactic representations) on the one hand and phonology (PF) and concepts (CF) on the other hand.\footnote{
Throughout the dissertation I call the syntactic representations in the lexicon `lexical trees' in order to distinguish them from syntactic structures in the syntax.
}

In Nanosyntax, the lexicon contains lexical entries, which are links between lexical trees, phonological representations and conceptual representations \citep{starke2014}.\footnote{
The lexical tree does not have to correspond to both a phonological and a conceptual representation. Lexical trees that only correspond to a conceptual representations and not to phonological representations are (phrasal or clausal) idioms. Lexical trees that only correspond to phonological representations but not to conceptual representations are for instance irregular plurals.
} I leave the conceptual representation out of discussion for now, as it is not relevant for the discussion here. The fact that only syntax can create complex feature structures also has a consequence for lexical entries in the lexicon.
Syntactic structures are constrained by certain principles, such that only well-formed syntactic structures exist. Since lexical entries in the lexicon link lexical trees to phonological and conceptual representation, these lexical trees are constrained by the same principles as syntactic structures are.
As a result, the lexicon only contains well-formed lexical trees. The lexicon does not contain unstructured `feature bundles', because they could never be created by syntax.

Following this logic, a feature bundle as in \ref{ex:feature-set} cannot exist. It cannot have entered syntax, because syntax starts with atomic features. It can also not be created by syntax, because complex structures can only be created with merge.

\ex. [ \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2, \tsc{k}3 ]\label{ex:feature-set}

Instead, a possible lexical tree looks as in \ref{ex:feature-structure}. The features are merged one by one in a binary structure.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{dat}P
      [\tsc{k}3]
      [\ac{acc}P
          [\tsc{k}2]
          [\tsc{k}1]
      ]
  ]
\end{forest}\label{ex:feature-structure}

This structure leads to the concept of phrasal spellout: not terminals but multiple syntactic heads (phrases) are realized with a single piece of phonology (i.e. a single morpheme). Applying this to \ref{ex:feature-structure}, not the terminals \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3 receive a realization, but \ac{acc}P and \ac{dat}P are spelled out. A necessary requirement is that these multiple syntactic heads form a constituent. That means that \ac{dat}P cannot be spelled out without \ac{acc}P.

Let me illustrate all of the above with the Faroese pronouns from Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive}. I simplify the situation in two respects. First, I do not show the internal complexity of the pronouns, including person and number features. Instead, I give a triangle, indicating that this is a complex syntactic structure. I refer to is as the person-number phrase it refers to, e.g. 2\ac{sg}P. Second, in this simplified representation I consider the Faroese pronouns to be monomorphemic. I ignore the fact that all three pronouns have the stem \tit{t} with a suffix following it.

The lexical entry for \tit{tú} is given in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon}. The lexical tree consists of the second person singular pronoun (the 2\ac{sg}P), and \tsc{k}1, making it a \ac{nom}P. The phonological representation that is linked to the lexical tree is \tit{tú}.\footnote{
Throughout the dissertation, I use lexical trees and phonological forms connected by a double arrow (⇔) to refer to a lexical entry.

The lexical trees and their phonological counterparts I gave in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon} to \ref{ex:faroese-taer-lexicon} are lexical entries.
These lexical entries are used to spell out syntactic structures. I give examples of syntactic structures in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-spellout} to \ref{ex:faroese-taer-spellout}.

The lexical tree in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon} is identical to the syntactic structure in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-spellout}. Therefore, this syntactic structure is spelled out as \tit{tú}.\footnote{
Throughout this dissertation I circle the part of the syntactic structure that corresponds to a particular lexical entry, and I place the corresponding phonology under it.

In the Faroese examples above, the syntactic structures are all identical to the lexical trees. However, Nanosyntax assumes that to be a successful match, identity is not a necessary requirement. Instead, matching relies on a containment relation. This is formalized as in \ref{ex:superset-principle}.

\ex. \tbf{The Superset Principle} \citet{starke2009}:\\
A lexically stored tree matches a syntactic node iff the lexically stored tree contains the syntactic node.
\label{ex:superset-principle}

Let me illustrate this with the Dutch second person plural pronoun from Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive}. This pronoun is syncretic between between the nominative, accusative and dative.
The lexicon only contains a single lexical entry, namely \ref{ex:dutch-jullie-lexicon}. The lexical tree consists of the complex lexical tree that corresponds to the second person plural pronoun (the \ac{2}\ac{pl}P), and \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3 making it a \ac{dat}P. The phonological representation that is linked to the lexical tree is \tit{jullie}.
The nominative, the accusative and the dative can all be spelled out with this single lexical entry using the Superset Principle in \ref{ex:superset-principle}.

The syntactic structure of the dative, given in \ref{ex:dutch-jullie-spellout-dat}, is the least exciting of the three. It is identical to the lexical tree \ref{ex:dutch-jullie-lexicon}, and therefore, spelled out as \tit{jullie}.

A question arises at this point. Why are the accusative and nominative in Faroese not spelled out by the lexical entry for the dative (and why is the nominative not spelled out by the lexical entry for the accusative)? These syntactic structures are namely contained in the lexical tree for the dative (and the accusative).
The reason for this comes from how competition between lexical entries is regulated in Nanosyntax. When two lexical entries compete, the best fit wins. The best fit is the lexical tree with the least features that are not used. This is formalized as in \ref{ex:elsewhere-condition}.

\ex. \tbf{The Elsewhere Condition} (\citealt{kiparsky1973}, formulated as in \citealt{caha2020}):\\
When two entries can spell out a given node, the more specific entry wins. Under the Superset Principle governed insertion, the more specific entry is the one which has fewer unused features.
\label{ex:elsewhere-condition}

I show how the Superset Principle and the Elsewhere Condition interact in a competition with the Faroese lexical entries I discussed earlier in this section. I only discuss the nominative \tit{tú} and the accusative \tit{teg}, because for the dative \tit{tær} there is only a single candidate that contains all features: the lexical entry \tit{tær}.

Consider first again the syntactic structure for the nominative in \ref{ex:faroese-tu-structure-nom}, repeated from \ref{ex:faroese-tu-spellout}.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom

The three lexical entries for \tit{tú}, \tit{teg} and \tit{tær} are candidates for this syntactic structure.
I repeat them in \ref{ex:faroese-lexicon-nom}, marking the subpart of the tree that matches the syntactic structure in gray.

Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive} contains two more attested patterns: the ABB pattern in Icelandic and the AAB pattern in German. In the remainder of this section I show how these two patterns are derived. I also show how the system is unable to derive an ABA pattern, which is crosslinguistically unattested \citep{baerman2005,caha2009,zompi2017}.

Consider the Icelandic pattern. For the first person plural, Icelandic uses \tit{við} as nominative and \tit{okkur} as accusative and dative. Two lexical entries are needed for this. The first one in \ref{ex:icelandic-vid-lexicon} contains pronominal features and \tsc{k}1, and corresponds to the phonology \tit{við}.
The second one is given in \ref{ex:icelandic-okkur-lexicon}. It contains in addition to \ref{ex:icelandic-vid-lexicon} also the feature \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3. The phonological representation that is linked to it is \tit{okkur}.

This last example also illustrates that the laid out system is unable to derive an ABA pattern. The unability of the system to derive such a pattern is a welcome one, since the pattern is unattested crosslinguistically. In an ABA pattern, the nominative and the dative are syncretic, to the exclusion of the accusative. Such a language would be like German but then the nominative would be \tit{ihr} instead of \tit{sie}.

This result could never be derived with the lexical entries given in \ref{ex:german-sie-lexicon} and \ref{ex:german-ihr-lexicon}. \tit{Ihr} is inserted for the dative and the cases contained in it (so for accusative and nominative), unless a more specific lexical entry is found. \tit{Sie} is the more specific lexical entry that is found from the accusative on. From the accusative on (so for the accusative and nominative), \tit{sie} will be inserted until a more specific entry is found. If no entry is specified for nominative, \tit{sie} will surface. \tit{Ihr} will not resurface, because the lexical entry for \tit{sie} is and will remain to be more specific.

In sum, the cumulative case decomposition from Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} can derive the observed syncretism patterns.

\section{Deriving morphological case containment}

Some languages morphologically reflect the case scale \ac{nom} < \ac{acc} < \ac{dat}. Khanty is an example of such a language. The phonological form of the accusative literally contains the phonological form of the nominative, and the form of the dative contains the form of the accusative. In this section I show how morphological case containment can be derived from the case decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. I repeat an example from Khanty that shows morphological case containment in Table \ref{tbl:cont-khanty-3sg} \pgcitep{nikolaeva1999}{16}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \center
  \caption {Morphological case containment of 3\ac{sg} in Khanty}
    \input{tables/containment-nom-acc-dat.tex}
  \label{tbl:cont-khanty-3sg}
\end{table}

The intuition is the following. The morphological form of the pronouns mirrors the cumulative feature decomposition given in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. That is, the accusative has the morphology that the nominative has (\tit{luw}) plus something extra (\tit{e:l}). Similarly, the accusative also has the features that the nominative has (\tsc{k}1) plus something extra (\tsc{k}2). The dative has the morphology that the accusative has (\tit{luw-e:l}) plus something extra (\tit{na}). Again, similarly, the dative has the features that the accusative has (\tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2) plus something extra (\tsc{k}3).

Before I show how languages with morphological case containment can be derived, I need to discuss how variation between languages is modeled in Nanosyntax. Crosslinguistic variation is namely explained in terms of differences in the lexicon. In other words, the syntactic structure is identical across languages, but the lexical entries package features together differently.

Let me discuss the differences between synthetic and agglutinative morphology to make this more concrete. Take the accusative, which contains \tsc{k}1 and \tsc{k}2 in all languages. The languages discussed in the previous section, Section \ref{sec:syncretism}, are all synthetic languages. \tsc{k}2 can only be spelled out in a single lexical entry together with \tsc{k}1. The result is that the examples are syncretic (i.e. formally identical) or suppletive (i.e. formally unrelated). The language I discuss in this section is agglutinative. \tsc{k}2 is not spelled out in the same lexical entry with \tsc{k}1. Instead, the \tsc{k}2 is spelled out by its own lexical entry. The result is that the accusative formally contains the nominative.

Let me illustrate this by deriving the 3\ac{sg} paradigm in Khanty.
First, I give the lexical entry for the nominative third person singular. It contains pronominal features and the feature \tsc{k}1. The phonological form associated with the structure is \tit{luw}. The lexical entry is given in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-lexicon}.

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{nom}P
      [\tsc{k}1]
      [3\ac{sg}P
          [\phantom{xxx}, roof]
      ]
  ]
  {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{luw}}; }
\end{forest}\label{ex:khanty-luw-lexicon}

The syntactic structure in for the nominative is given in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-spellout}. It is contained in the lexical tree in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-spellout}, and the nominative is spelled out as \tit{luw}.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\ac{nom}P,
tikz={
\node[label=below:\tit{luw},
draw,circle,
scale=0.8,
fit to=tree]{};
}
    [\tsc{k}1]
    [3\ac{sg}P
        [\phantom{xxx}, roof]
    ]
]
\end{forest}\label{ex:khanty-luw-spellout}

As shown in Table \ref{tbl:cont-khanty-3sg}, the morphological form of the accusative contains the morphological form of the nominative \tit{luw} plus an extra morpheme \tit{e:l}. As shown in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}, the syntactic features of the accusative contain the syntactic features of the nominative \tsc{k}1 plus an extra feature \tsc{k}2.
Accordingly, I give the lexical entry for the accusative marker \tit{e:l} in \ref{ex:khanty-el-lexicon}.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{acc}P
      [\tsc{k}2]
  ]
  {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{e:l}}; }
\end{forest}\label{ex:khanty-el-lexicon}

Note that it is crucial here to have a theory in which the features that form an accusative contain the features that form a nominative. If not, it would be a surprise that the nominative form is contained in the accusative form. The same holds for the accusative and dative.

\tit{Luw-e:l} consists of two morphemes that both correspond to their own piece of syntactic structure: \tit{luw} and \tit{e:l}. But how do these two morphemes combine? This issue brings me to another detour into the Nanosyntactic theory, which is about spellout-driven movement.

As discussed in the previous section, spellout in Nanosyntax only targets constituents. That means that it is impossible to let \ac{acc}P spell out as \tit{e:l} while it contains \ac{nom}P.\footnote{
Notice that this also gives the incorrect order of the morphemes: \tit{e:l-luw} instead of \tit{luw-e:l}.
}

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\ac{acc}P,name=accp, s sep=20mm,
tikz={
\node[draw,ellipse,rotate=35,yscale=0.4,
fit=(acc)(accp),
label={below left:\tit{e:l}}]{};
}
    [\tsc{k}2,name=acc]
    [\ac{nom}P,
    tikz={
    \node[label=below:\tit{luw},
    draw,circle,
    scale=0.8,
    fit to=tree]{};
    }
        [\tsc{k}1]
        [3\ac{sg}P
            [\phantom{xxx}, roof]
        ]
    ]
]
\end{forest}
\label{ex:khanty-el-luw-spellout}

The lexical entry in \ref{ex:khanty-el-lexicon} can only match the syntactic structure if \ac{nom}P moves away, leaving the \ac{acc}P containing \tsc{k}2 behind. In other words, the syntactic structure needs to be modified in such a way that the complement of \tsc{k}2 is not in the way anymore.

Exactly this movement is one of the two so-called `evacuation movements' that is part of the spellout procedure in Nanosyntax.\footnote{
In Part \ref{part:deriving} I introduce and illustrate the spellout procedure in more detail.
} I showed in the previous section that lexical entries are matched using the Superset Principle and the Elsewhere Condition. If there is no match in the lexicon for a particular syntactic structure, two types of (evacuation) movement can take place, in a fixed order.\footnote{
The two types of movement are cyclic movement and snowball movement, also used to derive the possible orders in \tsc{Dem} > \tsc{Num} > \tsc{Adj} > \tsc{N} \citep{cinque2005}.}
The movement types change the syntactic structure in such a way that they generate new constituents that are possible matches for spellout.\footnote{
This type of movement is different from syntactic movement. It is driven by spellout, it does not have any interpretational effects, and it does not leave any traces \citep{starke2018}.
}
For the discussion in this section, only the second type of movement is relevant: complement movement. In this type of movement, the complement of a particular feature moves to the specifier of that same feature.

This is exactly the type of movement I described as necessary for the Khanty pronoun. The movement is displayed in \ref{ex:khanty-luw-el-movement}. The complement of \tsc{k}2, the \ac{nom}P, moves to the specifier of \ac{acc}P.\footnote{
In its landing position the internal structure of the \ac{nom}P is no longer shown (to save some space), and its phonological form is placed under the triangle. The strikethrough of the lower \ac{nom}P indicates that the complement of \tsc{k}2 disappears.

Notice here that it is not a coincidence that the lexical tree for \ref{ex:khanty-el-lexicon} has a unary bottom, meaning that it only has a single feature at the bottom of its structure. Lexical entries with unary bottoms can only be inserted after an instance of spell-out driven movement has taken place \citep{starke2018}.

Just as Khanty has an additional morpheme that appears in the accusative, it also has a morpheme that appears in the dative. Similarly, just as the accusative has one more feature than the nominative (\tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 vs. \tsc{k}1), the dative has one more feature than the accusative (\tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2, \tsc{k}3 vs. \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2).

In sum, the cumulative case decomposition from Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} can derive the morphological case containment facts.

\section{The intuition for headless relatives}

In headless relatives, the internal case and the external case compete to surface on the relative pronoun. The two competing cases adhere to the case scale \ac{nom} < \ac{acc} < \ac{dat}, in which cases more to the right always win over cases more to the left. In this section I show how case competition in headless relatives can be derived from the case decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}.

% I repeat the summary of the data pattern for Gothic in Table \ref{tbl:summary-gothic-deriving}. I gave the cells different shadings depending on which cases compete. The dark gray cells are the ones in which dative and the accusative compete, and the dative wins. The light gray cells are the ones in which the dative and the nominative compete, and the dative again wins. The uncolored cells are the ones in which the accusative and the nominative compete, and the accusative wins.

The intuition is the following. Case competition in headless relatives reflects the cumulative feature decomposition given in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. A case wins the competition if it contains all features the other case has. The dative contains all features that the accusative has, so the dative surfaces. Similarly, the dative contains all features the nominative has, and again the dative surfaces. Lastly, the accusative contains all features the nominative has, so the accusative surfaces. I illustrate this per case pair.

I start with the competition between dative and accusative, in which dative wins. Table \ref{tbl:summary-gothic-deriving-datacc} shows the summary of the data pattern with the cells in which the dative and the accusative compete marked in gray.

In \ref{ex:dat-contains-acc} I show the syntactic structure of a dative relative pronoun. For now I let syntactic structure that has to do with being a relative pronoun correspond to a complex XP. I elaborate on the exact content of XP in Part \ref{part:deriving} of the dissertation.
Following that, a dative relative pronoun contains the XP, \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3.
Contained in this structure is an accusative relative pronoun, marked in gray. This consists of the XP, \tsc{k}1 and \tsc{k}2.
The larger structure wins over the smaller structure it contains: the dative wins over the accusative.

In sum, the cumulative case decomposition from Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} can derive the case scale observed for case competition in headless relatives.

\section{Summary}

In Chapter \ref{ch:recurring} I showed that the case scale appears in several subparts of language, among which in case competition in headless relatives. The goal of the current chapter is to provide a theory that anchors the case scale deeply in the linguistic system, such that the different appearances of the case scale are merely reflexes of a single trigger.

In this chapter, I showed how this can be achieved by assuming a cumulative case decomposition. Besides this, I assume a Nanosyntactic framework, in which syntactic structures are built from single features, and matched onto lexical entries in the postsyntactic lexicon.
I showed how a cumulative case decomposition can derive the case scale observed in syncretism patterns, morphological case containment and case competition in headless relatives.

Regarding syncretism, several patterns are attested crosslinguistically (ABC, AAA, AAB and ABB) but one is not: ABA. This follows in a system in which syncretic forms are realized by a single lexical entry. A lexical entry can be applied if it contains all features, as long as there is no more specific one.
Languages with morphological case containment show the cumulative case decomposition in their morphology. The phonological form of the accusative contains the form of the nominative plus an extra morpheme. The phonological form of the dative contains the form of the accusative plus an extra morpheme.

For headless relatives, the idea is that a case wins the competition if it contains all features the other case has. As the dative is the richest in features (it contains \tsc{k}1, \tsc{k}2 and \tsc{k}3), it wins over the accusative (which consists of \tsc{k}1 and \tsc{k}2) and the nominative (which contains only \tsc{k}1). Finally, the accusative wins over the nominative, because the former is richer in features than the latter.
