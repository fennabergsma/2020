\section{Diachronic part}

First, German only had the d-pronoun and attraction. The pattern of attraction that came with that pronoun is ext only.
At some point, German invented the wh-pronoun. Helmut showed how it emerged. With that came the other pattern: int only. Some people lost the attraction (but everybody kept the d-pronoun) and with that the pattern disappeared.
So the patterns in headless relatives follow from the relative pronouns in the language.
