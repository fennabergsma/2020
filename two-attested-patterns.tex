\chapter{Two attested patterns}

In Part X of this dissertation, I discussed a first aspect of case competition in headless relatives. When there is case competition, reference is always made to the same case scale: there is a fixed order that determines which case wins. The same case scale is used crosslinguistically.

However, there is a second aspect to headless relatives, which differs across languages. This has to do with whether case competition takes place in the first place. Languages differ in whether they allow the internal case or the external case to win the case competition. Logically speaking, there are three patterns possible for languages that show case competition.\footnote{
In this stage, I do not discuss languages that do not allow internal or external case to win the case competition, because they do not show case competition. In Section X I come back to this kind of language.
}

The first possibility is that a language allows both the internal and the external case to win the competition. In this type of language, any two cases can be the internal and external case, and the case more to the right on the case scale surfaces.
The second possibility is that a language allows the internal case to win the case competition, but it does not allow the external case to. In this type of language, only the internal case gets to surface if it is more to the right on the case scale. If the external case is more to the right on the case scale, it does not surface. In fact, there is no grammatical result possible.
The third possibility is that a language allows the external case to win the case competition, but it does not allow the internal case to. In this type of language, only the external case gets to surface if it is more to the right on the case scale. If the internal case is more to the right on the case scale, it does not surface, and no grammatical result is possible.

In this chapter I show that two of these three patterns are attested crosslinguistically. The first pattern, in which both internal and external case can win, is the one already exemplified by Gothic. I show that there is another language that shows the same pattern: Old High German. The second pattern, in which only the internal case wins, is exemplified by Modern German. There is no language in which only the external case wins the case competition. A summary of the patterns is given in \ref{tbl:int-ext-summary}.

\end{table}

After I discuss the possible languages that show case competition, I briefly turn to some that do not.
For instance, Polish is an example of a language that only allows for headless relatives in which the two cases are identical (or the phonological form that corresponds to the two cases is identical).
Two other examples are Old English and Greek, which always let their relative pronoun appear in the external case, no matter the internal case.

\subsection{Old High German}

% Old High German is widely discussed in the literature because of its case attraction (references).
%
% \ex. example case attraction
%
% by extension, examples with external case surfacing in headless relatives are also discussed
% to the best of my knowledge, there is no systematic study of direction: int to ext or ext to int

Old High German shows the same pattern as Gothic. The relative pronoun can surface in the internal or the external case, depending on which case is more to the right on the case scale. This conclusion follows from my own research of the texts Der althochdeutsche Isidor, The Monsee fragments, Otfrid's Evangelienbuch and Tatian in ANNIS3.\footnote{
https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/annis3/
} The examples below follow the spelling and the detailed glosses in ANNIS3. The translations are my own.

Consider the example in \ref{ex:ohg-acc-nom}. In this example, the internal case is nominative and the external case is accusative.
The internal case is nominative. The predicate \tit{gisizzen} `to possess' takes nominative subjects.
The external case is accusative. The predicate \tit{bibringan} `to give rise to' takes accusative objects.
The relative pronoun \tit{dhen} `\ac{rel}.\ac{acc}.\ac{m}.\ac{sg}' appears in the external case: the accusative. The relative pronoun is not marked in bold, just like as the main clause, showing that the relative pronoun patterns with the main clause.

% Context: the voice of God speaks through him (I think Jesaja):

\exg. ``Ih bibringu fona iacobes samin endi fona iuda dhen \tbf{mina} \tbf{berga} \tbf{chisitzit}.''\\

There is a counterexample.
Consider the example in \ref{ex:ohg-counterexample}. In this example, the internal case is nominative and the external case is accusative. Surprisingly, the relative pronoun appears in the case lower on the case scale.
The internal case is nominative. The predicate \tit{giheilen} `to save' takes nominative subjects.

\section{Only internal case wins}

There is really case competition: see appendix

\section{No only external case wins}



\section{Patterns without case competition}

Old English, Old Icelandic both show: \tsc{d}-pronoun plus invariant relativizer + always take case from the main clause

Greek

Ancient Greek also actually has both directions (see \cite{vanriemsdijk2006}), so there is actually not a language with external only + hierarchy effects


% The nativeness of the headless relative constructions under
% consideration, and in particular those represented by group (I), can be
% established for the moment by citing instances in which they occur independently
% of the Greek, e.g., in which the Gothic modified relative clause
% reflects a Greek participial construction or a noun, or instances in which
% they occur in opposition to the Greek. Evidence of the first type is
% found in Mk 10:32, Luk 3:13, Rom 14:19, II Cor 8:11, Col 3:2, and elsewhere.

Polish and Italian have \tsc{wh}-pronouns but do not allow for conflicts


What does not exist: external only
