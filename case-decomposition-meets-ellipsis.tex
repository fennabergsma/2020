\chapter{Case decomposition and ellipsis}

At the beginning of the previous chapter I showed that the case scale \tsc{nom < acc < dat} appears in headless relatives. In most accounts for headless relatives (\citealt[cf.][]{pittner1995,vogel2001,grosu2003,harbert1978}, an exception to this is \citealt{himmelreich2017}) the case scale is stipulated. Headless relatives simply obey to that hierarchy. \pgcitet{pittner1995}{201:fn.4} makes this explicit: ``One of the reviewers notes that an explanation in terms of a Case hierarchy is rather stipulative. However, as far as I know, nobody has suggested a nonstipulative explanation for these facts.''

What I showed as well in the previous chapter is the case scale \tsc{nom < acc < dat} is a wide-spread phenomenon: it recurs. The scale can be observed in at least two more syntactic phenomena: agreement en relativization.\footnote{
In this dissertation I do not work out accounts for these two syntactic phenomena. They merely serve as an illustration that the pattern is reflected in other syntactic phenomena as well.}
The case scale also appears within morphology in syncretism patterns and formal containment. \pgcitet{pittner1995}{201:fn.4} makes this link to morphology as well: ``Furthermore, the Case hierarchies receive some independent support by morphology as shown by the various inflectional paradigms.''

I am not after a theory in which the case hierarchy is not something construction specific, and syntax and morphology both have their own case hierarchy. I argue that there is a single trigger that is responsible for the case scale in different subparts of language \citep[cf.][on numeral constructions]{caha2019}. Specifically, I show that the observed case scale naturally follows on the assumption that the case hierarchy is deeply anchored in syntax. The case scale in morphology and syntax are merely reflexes of how case is organized in language.\footnote{
\citet{himmelreich2017} works this intuition out in a different way.
}

In this chapter I show that the case scale can be derived is case is decomposed. The precise facts in headless relatives relatives follow after adding an ellipsis that deletes phrases.


\section{Case decomposition}

The intuition: case is complex

containment:

\exg. luw -e:l -na\\
 3\tsc{sg}.\ac{nom} -\ac{acc} -\ac{dat}\\ \flushfill{Khanty, \pgcitealt{nikolaeva1999}{16}}

syncretism:

contigent zones, no ABA. spellout is not only exact match, but also a subset of the features can be a match

I show how this can be derived, within Nanosyntax, the framework in which I work this proposal out.



\subsection{The basic idea}

\citet{caha2009,caha2013} (followed by \citealt[cf.][]{starke2009,bobaljik2012,mcfadden2018,smith2019,vanbaal2018}) has extensively argued that case should be decomposed into privative features. Specifically, the decomposition is cumulative: each case has a different number of case features, and the number grows monotonically.
This is illustrated in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. Accusative has all the features that nominative has (here \tsc{f}1) plus one extra (here \tsc{f}2). Dative has all the features accusative has (\tsc{f} and \tsc{f}2) plus one extra (\tsc{f}3).

\begin{table}[ht]
  \center
	\caption {Case decomposed}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    case      & features                      \\
    \midrule
    \tsc{nom} & \tsc{f}1                      \\
    \tsc{acc} & \tsc{f}1, \tsc{f}2            \\
    \tsc{dat} & \tsc{f}1, \tsc{f}2, \tsc{f}3  \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:case-decomposed}
\end{table}

The decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed} forms the basis to derive the case scale effects observed in the previous chapter. The next section shows how case containment and syncretism effects follow naturally. Later in this chapter I show how the decomposition also derives the case competition facts in headless relatives.

%should I talk about alternatives and why they do not work?


\subsection{Deriving syncretism}

In this section I show how case syncretism patterns can be derived from the case decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. I repeat an example that shows the possible and impossible syncretism patterns in Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \center
  \caption {Syncretism pattern}
    \input{tables/syncretism-nom-acc-dat.tex}
  \label{tbl:syncretisms-derive}
\end{table}

The intuition is the following.
%In Nanosyntax (the framework I shall be using in this study), lexical
% items apply to feature sets not based on identity, but on the basis of a containment
% relation.

 % The morphological form of the pronouns mirror the cumulative feature decomposition given in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. That is, the accusative has the morphology that the nominative has (\tit{luw}) plus something extra (\tit{-e:l}). The dative has the morphology that the accusative has (\tit{luw-e:l}) plus something extra (\tit{luw-e:l}-na). In what follows I make it concrete how syntactic features translate to morphological form.


The proposal in this dissertation is worked out in Nanosyntax. I provide background assumptions on the framework whenever necessary to follow the discussion as I proceed. At this point I discuss the general architecture of Nanosyntax, its lexicon, phrasal spellout and matching between syntax and the lexicon.

The architecture of Nanosyntax is schematically shown in Figure \ref{fig:nano} \citep[from][]{vandenwyngaerd2020,caha2019}. In Nanosyntax, syntax starts with atomic features, and it builds complex syntactic trees. Specifically, there are no `feature bundles' that enter the syntax. The only way complex feature structures come to exist is a a result of merge.
After syntax (actually, each instance of merge), the syntactic structure is matched against the lexicon for pronunciation. The lexicon `translates' between syntactic representations on the one hand and phonology (PF) and concepts (CF) on the other hand. So, Nanosyntax is a late insertion model: (lexical) insertion takes place late, namely after syntax.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 1cm, auto]
    \tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, text width=5em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=2em]
    \tikzstyle{line} = [draw, -latex']
      \node [block] (syntax) {Syntax};
      \node [block, below of=syntax, node distance=1.5cm] (lexicon) {Lexicon};
      \node [block, below left=0.5cm and -1cm of lexicon] (pf) {PF};
      \node [block, below right=0.5cm and -1cm of lexicon] (cf) {CF};
      \path [line] (syntax) -- (lexicon);
      \path [line] (lexicon) -- (pf);
      \path [line] (lexicon) -- (cf);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Nanosyntactic model of grammar}
  \label{fig:nano}
\end{figure}

In Nanosyntax, the lexicon is nothing but links between syntactic representations, phonological representations and conceptual representations \citep{starke2014}.\footnote{
The syntactic representation does not have to correspond to both a phonological and a conceptual representation. Syntactic representation that only correspond to a conceptual representations and not to phonological representations are (phrasal or clausal) idioms. Syntactic representations that only correspond to phonological representations but not to conceptual representations are for instance irregular plurals.
}
I leave the conceptual representation out of discussion for now, as it not relevant for the discussion here. The fact that only syntax can create complex feature structures also has a consequence for the content of the lexicon.
Syntactic structures are constrained by certain principles, such that only well-formed syntactic structures exist. Since the lexical items from the lexicon link syntactic representation to phonological and conceptual representation, these syntactic representations are constrained by the same principles as syntactic trees are. As a result, the lexicon only contains well-formed syntactic structures. The lexicon does not contain unstructured `feature bundles', because they could never be created by syntax.

Following this logic, the syntactic representation for a lexical entry as in \ref{ex:feature-set} cannot exist. The feature bundle cannot have entered syntax, because syntax starts with atomic features. It can also not be created by syntax, because complex structures can only be created with merge.

\ex. [ \tsc{f}1, \tsc{f}2, \tsc{f}3 ]\label{ex:feature-set}

Instead, a possible syntactic representation for a lexical entry looks as in \ref{ex:feature-structure}. The features are merged one by one in a binary syntactic structure.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{dat}P
      [\ac{f}3]
      [\ac{acc}P
          [\ac{f}2]
          [\ac{f}1]
      ]
  ]
\end{forest}\label{ex:feature-structure}

This structure leads to the concept of phrasal spellout. Phrasal spellout is that not terminals but multiple syntactic heads (phrases) are realized with a single piece of phonology (i.e. a single morpheme). A necessary requirement is that these multiple syntactic heads form a constituent.

Let me illustrate all of the above with the Faroese pronouns from Table \ref{tbl:syncretisms-derive}. I simplify the situation in two respects. First, I do not show the internal complexity of the pronouns, including person and number features. Instead, I give a triangle, indicating that this is a complex syntactic structure. Second, in this simplified representation I consider the Faroese pronouns to be monomorphemic. I ignore the fact that all three pronouns clearly have the stem \tit{t} with a suffix on it.

The lexical entry for \tit{tú} `3\tsc{sg}.\tsc{nom}' is given in \ref{ex:faroese-tu}. The syntactic representation consists of the complex syntactic structure that corresponds to the third person singular pronoun, and \tsc{f}1, making it a \tsc{nom}P. The phonological representation that is linked to the syntactic representation in \tit{tú}.

\ex.

  ]
  {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{tú}}; }
\end{forest}
\label{ex:faroese-tu-lexicon}

The lexical entry for \tit{teg} `3\tsc{sg}.\tsc{acc}' is given in \ref{ex:faroese-teg}. The syntactic representation contains all the features of the syntactic structure in \ref{ex:faroese-tu}, plus \tsc{f}2, making it an \tsc{acc}P. The linked phonological representation is \tit{teg}.

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
  [\ac{acc}P
      [\ac{f}2]
      [\ac{nom}P
          [\ac{f}1]

          ]
      ]
  ]
  {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{teg}}; }
\end{forest}
\label{ex:faroese-teg-lexicon}

The lexical entry for \tit{tær} `3\tsc{sg}.\tsc{dat}' is given in \ref{ex:faroese-taer}. The syntactic representation contains all the features of the syntactic structure in \ref{ex:faroese-teg}, plus \tsc{f}3, making it an \tsc{dat}P. The linked phonological representation is \tit{tær}.

\subsection{Deriving case containment}

In this section I show how morphological case containment can be derived from the case decomposition in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. I repeat an example that shows morphological case containment in Table \ref{tbl:cont-khanty} \pgcitep{nikolaeva1999}{16}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \center
  \caption {Containment in \tsc{3sg} in Khanty}
    \input{tables/containment-nom-acc-dat.tex}
  \label{tbl:cont-khanty-3sg}
\end{table}

The intuition is the following. The morphological form of the pronouns mirror the cumulative feature decomposition given in Table \ref{tbl:case-decomposed}. That is, the accusative has the morphology that the nominative has (\tit{luw}) plus something extra (\tit{-e:l}). The dative has the morphology that the accusative has (\tit{luw-e:l}) plus something extra (\tit{luw-e:l}-na). In what follows I make it concrete how syntactic features translate to morphological form.

first the nominative

\ex.

      [\ac{nom}]
      [3\ac{sg}
          [.., roof]

    [NP,name=np

then the accusative
